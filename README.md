## Find Weight

The Find Weight is a web application that allows users to input their weight on Earth and obtain the equivalent weight on other planets in our solar system. Enter your weight in the input field and view the converted weights for each planet.

### Features

- Input your weight in kilograms
- Convert your weight to the equivalent weight on Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

The project is built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Running locally

To run the Find Weight locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

I have set prettier configuration to use single quote instead of double in my javascript file.
